# express-jokes-api-v1

currently you get a one liner joke if you go to the route /api/v1/get-one/liner

it returns a JSON with the ID and message, something like this

{
  "id": 36,
  "joke": "Why do ducks have tail feathers? To cover their buttquacks."
}

future implication can me two liner jokes and filters too for now this is it, it is just for test purposes
